### Research Interests

I am passionate about building systems that can perceive the world and behave in the wild, more like a human does, with explanations for the actions. Towards this goal, my research focuses on bridging the gap of human and machine intelligence through bringing inspiration from neuroscience to understand learning machines and facilitate improving the current state of interpretability and address the lack of robustness outside the training distribution. <br>
<br>
Explainable, Trustworthy and Robust Artificial Intelligence and Causal Inference <br>
