### Research Interests
I am interested in the applications of technology, particularly machine learning, towards improving healthcare and medicine.  So far, my research has focused on gene regulation by understanding where transcription factors bind to the genome.  This idea can be extended to manipulating gene regulation and could potentially have an impact in the fields of gene therapy and personalized medicine.  In the future, I hope to complete an MD-PhD, gain a strong understanding of the healthcare landscape, and become better equipped to develop machine learning tools which allow physicians to deliver more effective and more personalized care.
