### Research Interests

I have previously studied the immune tone establishment by lactic acid bacteria in the gut of the olive flounder and the transcription regulation of Factor IX promoter with site-directed mutagenesis and MPRA. I am interested in the transcription regulation and the evolution of cis-regulatory elements.
