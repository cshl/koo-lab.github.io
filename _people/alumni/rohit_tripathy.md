### Research Interests

Broadly speaking, I am interested in scientific machine learning, i.e., the application of, and development of new tools for solving problems in computational science. As a graduate student I worked on developing data-driven methods for uncertainty quantification. Currently, as a postdoc I am interested in the application of deep generative models to extract biologically meaningful insights from genomic data.
