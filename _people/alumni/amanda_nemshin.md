### Research Interests

I am currently interested in computer science, mathematics, and neuroscience. I previously worked with RNA-binding protein, eCIRP, to identify its role in inflammatory diseases. I am currently interested in deep neural networks and how they can be applied in different scientific fields like medicine.
